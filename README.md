# Neural_Network_Scratch
Implemented a Neural Network from scratch using NumPy

# Overview

Implementing algorithms from scratch is an effective way to gain a more profound 
knowledge and understanding of an algorithm. In this question, we implement a deep 
neural network from scratch with NumPy. For this purpose, the UTKFace dataset includes 
more than 23000 face images of people of different ages, races, and genders. In the first 
question, I train an artificial neural network for age prediction, then in the second part for 
race prediction, and last for gender prediction.


In the second question, I do calculations for a convolution layer. In the third question, I 
do a “Back propagation” operation for a simple convolution neural network that includes 
one convolution layer and one fully connected layer.
